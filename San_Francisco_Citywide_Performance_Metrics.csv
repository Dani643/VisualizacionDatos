Returned undeliverable mail indicates that a voter moved without updating his or her voter registration with a new address. Permanent VBM voters make up over 85% of VBM voters. To reduce the number of returned VBM ballots, and postage and cost incurred from the preparation of second ballots, an address confirmation mailer is mailed to these participants, including overseas and military voters. This mailer gives the participants an opportunity to update their residential address prior to the mailing of the permanent VBM ballots. The year-end value is the average of the percentages from each election in the fiscal year.;"Source: The numerator is the number of returned undeliverable permanent vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots, and the denominator is the total number of permanent VBM ballots issued. The number of returned undeliverable permanent VBM ballots is from ""Application Method and Ballot Type Issue Statistics"" aka AVMR056, a report from the Department's Election Information Management System (EIMS). The categories to be included in this measure are: 60-Day, Fed-Overseas, Mail Ballot, Perm AV, and PMLTY-O. The total number of permanent VBM ballots issued is currently extracted from EIMS through a customized SQL query. It also includes the following categories: 60-Day, Fed-Overseas, Mail Ballot, Perm AV, and PMLTY-O. Collection Method:  The report is available in EIMS: Election Workspace>Absentee Processing Menu>Reports and Jobs>AVMR056.

The year-end value is an average of the values from each election in the fiscal year.;Source: The Official Statement of Votes (SOV), the final post-election document that contains registration and vote totals for an election. Collection Method: For the SOV, registration data is extracted from the Election Information Management System (EIMS) and vote data is extracted from the voting system's WinEDS software. The numerator is the total number of vote-by-mail ballots cast in an election and the denominator is the total turnout in the election. In the Peformance Measurement System, values are entered for individual elections and the metric calculation is set to average these values across the fiscal year.

This measure was previously calculated using the CHANGES shelter management system that served adult shelters. In fiscal year 2020-21, the City�s COVID-19 emergency response created new sites and services managed in other data systems. These systems did not consistently track bed/room occupancy and bed/room inventory day-to-day. As a result, the department could not the calculate occupancy rate in the same way. The result of �96%� reflects an estimated point-in-time occupancy rate of shelter-in-place hotels as of July 29, 2021. The department suggests that this occupancy rate is a good approximation for all adult shelters.

The San Francisco Behavioral Health Plan offers a full range of specialty Behavioral health services provided by a culturally diverse network of community Behavioral health programs, clinics and private psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Most people seeking behavioral health services need only basic counseling services. For those who are in need of more extensive treatment, the S.F. Behavioral Health Plan offers an array of services.;Collection Method: The data used for this projection comes from the CMHS Billing and Information system (INSYST) which is service data entered by contract and civil service agencies.

A dry weather sewer overflow occurs when sanitary and storm sewers combine to overflow during weather conditions when the portion of flow attributed to storm water is negligible.;This rate is calculated as [the number of dry weather main sewer overflows] divided by [the total miles of combined collection system piping managed by SFPUC], then multiplied by 100. Overflows caused by severe wet weather are excluded. Overflows caused by limitations or problems within piping and facilities controlled by customers are excluded. This metric is defined by AWWA Utility Benchmarking standards.;Percent;FY2022-23;2023;0.026;;;;
